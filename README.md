### adir114.info
[adir114.info](http://web.archive.org/web/20141216200800/adir114.info) was my first real project, I've developed it when I was about 18. It was a frameworkless PHP web site with blog, uploading photos and other files, et cetera. It's dead since 2014, but you can look how awful it was via Wayback Machine.
