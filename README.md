## Programming
_My past projects_

### komentor
_Python, Django_
`komentor` is my current project for diploma.

### socmusrec
_JavaScript, AngularJS, VK API, Last.fm API, Azure_
[![socmusrec](/assets/img/socmusrec_little.jpg)](/assets/img/socmusrec.jpg)
`socmusrec` was a fully frontend project. It was about retrieving data about audios stored at personal vk.com pages, analyzing these audios by means of Last.fm api, and providing analysis results and comparation of two users' tastes in music - **in percents**. Asynchroneousity was developed with promises. It was great, **I loved this project**. Rest in peace.

All the code was written in JavaScript by means of AngularJS, the site was launched at Azure.

### israel_parser
_Python, lxml, tkinter, sqlite3, openpyxl_
![israel_parser](/assets/img/israel_parser.jpg)
`israel_parser` was about scraping of several bulletin boards. The app was a desktop one with GUI on `tkinter`, scraping was being launched manually, the results were being stored in `SQLite` database file and extracted to .xlsx files.

### rhymes-seeker
_PHP, MySQL_
![rhymes-seeker](/assets/img/rhymes-seeker.jpg)
`rhymes-seeker` was built ontop of an **enormous MySQL database of Ukrainian language**: all the words, about 1,000,000 forms of words.

A user provided a word, and `rhymes-seeker` answered with possible rhymes. Words were handled by their pronunciation.

`rhymes-seeker` was never launched due to bulkiness of its database, and now the database is lost.

### adir114.info
adir114.info was my first real project, I've developed it when I was about 18. It was a frameworkless PHP web site with blog, uploading photos and other files, et cetera. An MLM organization used it as its home page.

It's dead since 2014, but you can look how awful it was via Wayback Machine.
